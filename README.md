### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My latest focus has been on utilizing modern semantic HTML to create accessible experiences. I love spinning up static websites using serverless infrastructure on AWS. I also work at making web content readable in as many languages as possible.

Most of my public repositories here are just personal projects and experiments in various states. Take a look around and reach out if you have any questions!
